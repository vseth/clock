# Clock

A minimalist analogue clock, made for old phones and tablets

## Features

-   Cycles through light and dark background to prevent screen burn-in
-   In case of dark mode - always stays dark, saves energy in OLED displays since the backbround is black.
-   Clock dial stays at the center in portrait / landscape mode.
-   Supports "Add to homescreen" - opens the clock in full-screen mode like a regular app.
-   The second hand tiks every second using the internal time. The minute and hour hand bumps slightly each second.
